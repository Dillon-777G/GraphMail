NOTE: Attachment objects in Microsoft Graph already support
 immutable IDs, as inferred from observed API behavior.

Attempts to translate attachment IDs (e.g., to immutable ids) resulted in errors:

     value: ImmutableId, expected: EntryId'

This suggests the provided attachment IDs are already immutable.

        They are rare and we do not need the extra processing logic because they will
        not contain data relevant to our use case.

        NOTE: Attachment endpoints from the graph API do not support the filter
        parameter. This has been a known issue for roughly 4 years on Microsoft's 
        end. I don't think it will be fixed. The current workaround I am going to 
        use is to query it like a message and then use expand to filter.
